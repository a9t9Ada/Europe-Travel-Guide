			<p>Sitting quietly on a rock by the sea, the Little Mermaid watches over Copenhagen with a soft, timeless grace. Inspired by Hans 
			Christian Andersen’s beloved fairy tale, this small yet powerful statue captures the poetic soul of Denmark—melancholy, dreamy,
			and deeply connected to the sea. As waves gently lap at her feet and the harbor light shifts throughout the day, she feels almost
			alive, lost in thought. Simple and understated, yet rich in meaning, the Little Mermaid is not just a landmark, but a moment of calm 
			and reflection—a must-see symbol of Danish storytelling and quiet beauty.</p>

			<p>The Louvre isn’t just a museum — it’s basically the world’s biggest flex when it comes to art and history. Once a royal palace, it now
			holds over 35,000 pieces, from ancient Egyptian mummies to Renaissance masterpieces. It’s the home of icons like the Mona Lisa and the
			Venus de Milo, but honestly, the whole place feels like a treasure hunt where every hallway hides something wild.
			What makes the Louvre extra special is its vibe: that massive glass pyramid out front mixes old-school France with modern style and 
			inside you can jump from Greek statues to French crown jewels to Islamic art in just a few steps.</p>
