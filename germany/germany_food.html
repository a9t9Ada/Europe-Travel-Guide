			Schnitzel is one of Germany’s most beloved culinary treasures, a golden, crispy delight that has won hearts worldwide. Traditionally 
			made from tender veal, pork, or chicken, it’s pounded thin, breaded, and fried to perfection, creating a crunchy exterior that gives

			shredded cabbage that is naturally fermented, it develops a bright, slightly sour flavor that perfectly complements hearty meats like
			sausages, pork, or Schnitzel. Beyond its taste, sauerkraut carries the essence of German home cooking—simple ingredients transformed
			by patience and care into something deeply satisfying. Every forkful is a bite of history, culture, and the enduring spirit of German
			gastronomy.

			Bienenstich, or “Bee Sting Cake,” is a classic German pastry that’s as charming as it is delicious. A soft, yeasty cake is layered
			with sweet vanilla cream or custard, then crowned with a golden, caramelized honey-almond topping that gives a delicate crunch with
			every bite. Legend says a bee “stung” the baker when he first tried this honeyed treat—hence the name. Rich in flavor yet light in 
			texture, Bienenstich is a perfect example of Germany’s love for pastries, making it a must-try for anyone exploring the country’s 
			culinary heritage.
			with a slice of Tortilla de Patatas — it’s a classic you can’t miss.
