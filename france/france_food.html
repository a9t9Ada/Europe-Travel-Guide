				<img src = "images_france/bagguete1.jpg" alt = ">The French Baguette">
			</div>
			The French baguette isn’t just bread — it’s basically a national treasure. With its crispy golden crust and soft, airy center, the 
			baguette is a daily ritual in France. You’ll see people carrying one under their arm like it’s the most normal thing ever… because 
			it is.
			What makes it iconic is that traditional baguettes follow super strict rules: just flour, water, salt, and yeast — nothing fancy, 
			just pure craft. Fresh ones are baked several times a day, so grabbing a warm baguette from a local boulangerie is part of everyday 
			life.
			It’s simple, it’s timeless, and honestly, it’s one of the easiest ways to taste the real spirit of France. If you want to experience
			France like a local, start with a fresh baguette and thank me later.

			</div>
			Croissants are basically the buttery royalty of French pastries. Light, flaky, and impossibly soft inside, they’re the kind of treat
			that makes mornings in France feel a bit magical. Each layer is created through a careful folding process that gives croissants their
			signature airy texture — it’s legit craftsmanship, not just baking.
			You’ll find them in every boulangerie, usually still warm in the early morning. Pairing a fresh croissant with a coffee is a whole 
			vibe — simple, traditional, and honestly unbeatable. It’s one of those foods that shows how the French turn even the smallest things 
			into an art form.

			</div>
			A French cheese platter is literally a whole experience, not just a snack. France is famous for having hundreds of cheese varieties — 
			soft, hard, creamy, strong, mild… you name it, they’ve got it. A proper cheese platter usually mixes different textures and flavors: 
			something soft like Brie, something stronger like Roquefort, maybe a classic Comté, plus a few regional gems you discover along the way.
			It’s traditionally served after the main meal, which feels kinda fancy but also super homey at the same time. Pair it with fresh bread
			or fruit and you instantly get that elegant, timeless French dining vibe. Honestly, it’s one of the easiest ways to taste the diversity
			of French culture in just a few bites.

			</div>
			Crème Brûlée is one of those desserts that feels both classy and comforting — a smooth vanilla custard with that iconic caramelized 
			sugar crust on top. The best part is cracking the warm, crispy layer with your spoon to get to the cool, creamy inside… it just hits 
			different.
			This dessert has been part of French culinary tradition for centuries, and it’s often served in small ramekins to keep things elegant
			and simple. Rich, sweet, and timeless, Crème Brûlée is basically the definition of “treat yourself” in French cuisine.

			<h3>Paris Brest</h3>

			</div>
			Paris-Brest is a classic French pastry that looks like a giant, buttery wheel and tastes even better than it looks. Made from choux 
			pastry and filled with rich praline-flavored cream, it was originally created in 1910 to honor the Paris–Brest–Paris bicycle race — 
			hence the circular shape!
			It’s sweet, nutty, and utterly indulgent, making it one of the most beloved desserts in France. A slice of Paris-Brest is basically
			a bite of history and French pastry mastery all in one.

			</div>
			Macarons are the colorful, delicate, and utterly irresistible French treats that have stolen hearts worldwide. These small, round 
			confections are made from almond flour, egg whites, and sugar, and sandwiched together with luscious fillings like ganache, 
			buttercream, or jam.
			What makes macarons special is not just their pastel beauty, but their perfect balance of crisp shell and soft, chewy interior. 
			They’re often associated with Parisian elegance, afternoon tea, and those little moments of pure indulgence that feel fancy yet fun.
			Trying a variety of flavors is basically a must-do when visiting France!
