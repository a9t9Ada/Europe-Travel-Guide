			</div>
			Peka is one of Croatia’s most soulful and unforgettable dishes. Slow-cooked under a heavy iron bell covered with hot embers, peka
			brings together tender meat or fresh seafood, potatoes, herbs, olive oil, and garlic, all gently roasted until the flavors melt into
			perfection. The magic lies in patience — hours of slow cooking create deep, rustic aromas and fall-apart textures. Often prepared for
			family gatherings and special occasions, peka isn’t just a meal, it’s an experience — a timeless taste of Dalmatian tradition that
			invites visitors to slow down and savor Croatia the old-fashioned way.

			Crni rižot is one of Croatia’s most striking and flavorful coastal dishes. Made with cuttlefish or squid and enriched with their

			fresh herbs, it delivers a bold yet elegant taste that feels both rustic and refined. Loved along the Dalmatian coast, crni rižot is

			form.
