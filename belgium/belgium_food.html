			Belgian waffles aren’t just a breakfast treat — they’re basically the golden crown jewels of Belgium’s sweet scene. Crispy on the 
			outside, light and fluffy on the inside, they’re the kind of comfort food that makes any morning feel like a celebration. Each waffle
			is crafted with care, giving it that perfect grid pattern to hold syrup, chocolate, or fresh fruit. You’ll find them at street stalls,
			cafés, and markets across Belgium, often topped with whipped cream, berries, or a dusting of powdered sugar. Simple, indulgent, and 
			undeniably iconic, Belgian waffles show how Belgium turns even a humble batter into an art form — one bite, and you’ll totally get why
			they’re world-famous.

			served in brasseries and seafood restaurants across Belgium, often with a side of mayonnaise for dipping those fries. The beauty of
			moules-frites is in the balance: delicate seafood flavors meet hearty, crunchy fries, creating a meal that’s casual, traditional, and 
			totally unforgettable. Eating it feels like a little taste of Belgium’s coastal charm no matter where you are.

			Belgian chocolate pralines aren’t just sweets — they’re little masterpieces of flavor and craftsmanship. Each one is carefully
			hand-filled with rich ganaches, creams, or liqueurs, then coated in smooth, glossy chocolate. You’ll find them in elegant chocolate 
			shops across Belgium, often presented in beautiful boxes that feel like a gift even before you open them. The magic is in the contrast:
			silky, decadent fillings inside a crisp chocolate shell. Eating a praline is an experience — indulgent, precise, and undeniably Belgian.
			It’s the kind of treat that turns chocolate into an art form, and honestly, it’s a must-try for any visitor in Belgium.

			or mashed potatoes, every bite is warming, comforting, and utterly satisfying. It’s the kind of meal that tells a story of Belgian 
			tradition and hospitality — simple ingredients, masterfully prepared, and impossible to forget.
