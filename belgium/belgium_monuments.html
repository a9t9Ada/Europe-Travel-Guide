			</div>
			<p>Standing at the heart of Brussels, Grand Place is one of the most stunning city squares in Europe and a true symbol of Belgium’s
			history and pride. Surrounded by richly decorated guildhalls, the Town Hall, and the King’s House, the square showcases breathtaking
			Gothic and Baroque architecture that dates back to the 17th century. Every detail — from golden façades to ornate statues — tells a 
			story of Brussels’ past and craftsmanship. By day, Grand Place feels elegant and alive; by night, it glows with warm lights, creating
			an almost magical atmosphere. Whether you’re visiting during the famous Flower Carpet or simply passing through, Grand Place is more
			than a square — it’s the beating heart and soul of Brussels.</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Best time to visit:</strong><br>
				Spring to early autumn for mild weather; early morning or late afternoon to avoid crowds. Evening visits are magical when the square is 
				illuminated.<br>

				Open daily; the square itself is public and accessible at all times. Shops and museums around the square have varying hours (usually 10:00–18:00).<br>
				<strong>Entry:</strong><br>
				Free to enter the square itself. Some attractions/museums around require a small ticket (€5–€10).
