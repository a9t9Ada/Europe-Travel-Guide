			<p>The Arc de Triomphe is one of Paris’s most iconic monuments, standing proudly at the top of the Champs-Élysées.
			Commissioned by Napoleon in 1806, it was built to honor the soldiers who fought for France, especially during the Napoleonic Wars.
			The monument is decorated with detailed sculptures, engraved battle names, and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier — a powerful symbol of
			national remembrance.
			Visitors can climb to the top for one of the best panoramic views of Paris, with the city’s twelve avenues stretching out like a star
			from the monument’s base.
			A visit to the Arc de Triomphe is a journey through French history and one of the most breathtaking viewpoints in the capital.</p>

			<h3>Château de Villandry Gardens</h3>
			<div class = "gallery">
				<img src = "images_france/gardens.jpg" alt = "Château de Villandry Gardens">
				<img src = "images_france/gardens1.jpg" alt = "Château de Villandry Gardens">
			</div>
			<p>If you’re into places that feel like they’ve jumped straight out of a fairytale, Villandry’s gardens are literally that. This château 
			is famous not just for its Renaissance architecture, but for its mind-blowing gardens — perfectly shaped hedges, geometric flower 
			patterns, and terraces that look like they were crafted with insane precision centuries ago.
			The coolest part? Each garden has its own theme — the Ornamental Garden with its symbolically arranged shapes, the Water Garden that 
			feels super calm and reflective, and the Vegetable Garden, which somehow manages to make cabbages look aesthetic.</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Best time to visit:</strong><br>
				Spring and summer, when the gardens are in full bloom and colors are at their peak. Early morning is ideal to avoid crowds.<br>
				<strong>Opening hours:</strong><br>
				Daily, 9:00–19:00 (April–September); 9:00–17:00 (October–March).<br>
				<strong>Entry:</strong><br>
				Tickets required (~€12 for adults; children often free). Entry includes both the château and the gardens.

			<h3>Louvre Museum</h3>
			<div class = "gallery">
				<img src = "images_france/louvre1.jpg" alt = "Louvre Museum">
				<img src = "images_france/louvre.jpg" alt = "Louvre Museum">
			</div>
			<p>The Louvre isn’t just a museum — it’s basically the world’s biggest flex when it comes to art and history. Once a royal palace, it now
			holds over 35,000 pieces, from ancient Egyptian mummies to Renaissance masterpieces. It’s the home of icons like the Mona Lisa and the
			Venus de Milo, but honestly, the whole place feels like a treasure hunt where every hallway hides something wild.
			What makes the Louvre extra special is its vibe: that massive glass pyramid out front mixes old-school France with modern style and 
			inside you can jump from Greek statues to French crown jewels to Islamic art in just a few steps.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<strong>Best time to visit:</strong><br>
				Early morning on weekdays or late afternoon to avoid the largest crowds. Spring and autumn offer pleasant weather outside as well.<br>
				<strong>Opening hours:</strong><br>
				Tuesday–Sunday, 9:00–18:00; Wednesdays and Fridays, open until 21:45. Closed on Tuesdays.<br>
				<strong>Entry:</strong>
				Tickets required (~€17 online). Some exhibitions may have additional fees. Free for visitors under 18 and EU residents under 26.<br>
